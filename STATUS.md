# Project Status: Math Challenger

This document summarizes the current state of the project and outlines opportunities for future development. It is intended as a quick handoff for agents extending the app.

## Overview
- Multi-platform arithmetic quiz game with progressive difficulty levels
- **Web App:** React + TypeScript single-page app powered by Vite

## Current Functionality
- Levels and problem generation:
  - **Levels 1-10 (Multiple Choice):**
    - Level 1: two operands in [0..9], addition.
    - Level 2: two operands in [0..50], addition.
    - Level 3: two or three operands in [0..99], addition.
    - Level 4: a − b with a in [4..20], b in [2..(a−1)] (non-negative result).
    - Level 5: two or three numbers with +/-; first number in [5..15], subsequent in [1..20]; running total kept non-negative.
    - Level 6: two or three numbers in [0..20] with +/-; negatives allowed.
    - Level 7: same as 6 with a 20s countdown timer.
    - Level 8: same as 7 but operands drawn from [1..99].
    - Level 9: multiplication of two numbers in [0..9].
    - Level 10: two or three numbers in [1..30] with +/−/× and operator precedence (× before +/−), with a 13s countdown timer.
  - **Levels 11-20 (Text Input):**
    - Level 11: replicates Level 1 with text input (type="tel").
    - Level 12: replicates Level 2 with text input.
    - Level 13: replicates Level 3 with text input.
    - Level 14: replicates Level 4 with text input.
    - Level 15: replicates Level 5 with text input.
    - Level 16: replicates Level 6 with text input.
    - Level 17: replicates Level 7 with text input and 25s timer (+5s).
    - Level 18: replicates Level 8 with text input and 25s timer (+5s).
    - Level 19: replicates Level 9 with text input.
    - Level 20: replicates Level 10 with text input and 18s timer (+5s).
- Answer input methods:
  - **Levels 1-10**: Multiple choice with three options (1 correct + 2 distractors).
    - For levels 3+: wrong choices are biased so that 0/1/2 share the same last digit as the correct answer with probabilities 10%/45%/45% respectively.
    - A distance cap keeps wrong answers "near" the correct answer; the cap scales with range but never exceeds 40. The cap is enforced first, then the last-digit bias (pickers respect the cap).
  - **Levels 11-20**: Text input field with submit button, using input type="tel" for numeric entry.
- Feedback & flow:
  - Correct: shows "Correct! 🎉", locks inputs, and advances after ~800ms.
  - Level-up: after a streak of 20, shows "you made it to the next level!" and advances after ~500ms.
  - Wrong: shows "Try again…" and disables the clicked option (levels 1-10) or clears the input field (levels 11-20).
  - Timers: 20s countdown on levels 7 and 8; 13s countdown on level 10; 25s countdown on levels 17 and 18; 18s countdown on level 20; timeouts reset streak.
- Persistence:
  - `level` and `streak` are saved in `localStorage` and restored on refresh.
- Accessibility:
  - `aria-live` announcements for operation, feedback, and timer; labeled level selector; buttons for choices.

## Layout & UX Notes
- Bottom half: choices are always shown side-by-side (3 columns) and aligned to the top of the bottom section for proximity to the formula.
- Symmetric horizontal padding prevents buttons from touching screen edges.
- Mobile: viewport disables zoom (`user-scalable=no`), which may impact accessibility (see Known Limitations).

## Build, Run, and Checks
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Type-check: `npm run check`
- Build: `npm run build` (TypeScript build + Vite + post-build URL relativization)
- Preview: `npm run preview`

Notes on static hosting and local file usage:
- Vite config sets `base: './'` to emit relative asset URLs.
- The `relativize-dist.mjs` script additionally rewrites `/assets/...` to `assets/...` in `dist/index.html` to support `file://` opening and subpath hosting. With `base: './'`, this may be redundant, but it is kept to harden `dist/` for offline usage.

## Quality & Tooling
- TypeScript is enabled with strict settings (e.g., `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`).
- No linting or formatting setup (ESLint/Prettier) is present.
- No unit, integration, or e2e tests are present.
- No CI configured.

## Known Limitations / Gaps
- No division yet; mixed-operation mode with multiplication exists at Level 10 only.
- Scoring is streak-based only; no points/combos/leaderboard. Persistence is limited to `level` and `streak`.
- No sound effects or rich animations for feedback or level-up.
- No keyboard shortcuts (number keys/Enter/Escape) or explicit focus management on new question.
- Accessibility can be improved (reduced motion, high-contrast theme, focus traps).
- Mobile zoom disabled; consider an accessibility toggle to re-enable zoom.
- Internationalization missing (static English strings).
- Router has a single route; no deep links to settings.
- `dist/` is committed; decide policy for version control.

## Architectural Notes

### Shared Architecture
- **Pure Game Logic:** All game mechanics extracted to `android-app/gameLogic.ts`
- **Platform-Agnostic:** Core functions work identically on web and mobile
- **Type Safety:** Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency

### Web App Architecture
- Game state uses React state (`useState`) with shared logic functions
- UI-specific logic in `Game.tsx` (timers, persistence, routing)
- Timing handled with `setTimeout` and `locked` flag

### Android App Architecture
- React Native components with AsyncStorage persistence
- Touch-optimized UI with Alert dialogs for level selection
- Background timer management with proper cleanup

### Shared Patterns
- Choices keyed using `Date.now()`-derived IDs
- Consistent problem generation and validation
- Identical streak progression and color thresholds

## Suggested Backlog
- Functional
  - Division and mixed-ops mode (including multiplication beyond Level 9).
  - Optional timer for Level 9; alternative timer lengths per level.
  - Scoring system (points/combos), session summary, leaderboard.
  - Modes: timed blitz, practice (no auto-advance), custom ranges.
  - Persistence beyond level/streak (e.g., settings, mode, totals).
  - Keyboard shortcuts and better focus management on new questions.
  - Feedback polish: animations/toasts, confetti on level-up; optional sounds.
  - i18n scaffolding and language switcher.
  - PWA support for offline install and caching.
- Code quality & architecture
  - ✅ **COMPLETED:** Extract pure game helpers to shared `common/` folder
  - Add unit tests for shared game logic (vitest + RTL)
  - Add ESLint + Prettier; integrate CI for check/lint/test/build
  - Replace `Date.now()` in keys with stable/random IDs
  - Cross-platform testing strategy
- Deployment
  - Decide on committing `dist/`.
  - Add GitHub Pages/Static hosting workflow; verify hash routing.
  - If switching off hash routing, add server rewrites.
 - Accessibility
  - High-contrast theme, reduced motion options, and optional zoom toggle.

## Quick Start for Contributors
- Install: `npm install`
- Run: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build` (open `dist/index.html` directly if desired)

## Status Summary
- **Multi-Platform:** Web app and Android app both fully functional
- **Shared Logic:** Game mechanics centralized in `common/` for consistency
- **Complete Feature Set:** All 20 levels implemented across both platforms
  - Levels 1–10: addition, subtraction, mixed +/-, multiplication, and precedence (multiple choice)
  - Levels 11–20: same problem types as 1–10 but with text input (type="tel")
  - Timers on levels 7–8 (20s), 10 (13s), 17–18 (25s), and 20 (18s)
  - Streak progression (20 correct answers to advance)
- **Platform-Specific Features:**
  - Web: localStorage persistence, keyboard/mouse input
  - Android: AsyncStorage persistence, touch-optimized UI

## UI: Streak Display
- Levels 1–19: streak shows as `x/20` to indicate progress to the next level.
- Level 20 (final): shows only the streak number; displays a 🎉 when the streak goes above 20.
- Streak color thresholds (progressive):
  - 5: orange
  - 10: yellow
  - 15: light green
  - 18: green
- Streak-based progression with level-up message and delayed advance; level and streak persist via localStorage.
- Wrong-answer generation improved for levels 3+ (last-digit bias and distance cap).
- Tooling and tests still minimal; good candidates for next iteration.
